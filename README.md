Hi! My name is Kai Guo (郭凯). I’m a master’s student from the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University.

My research interests lie in **multimodal learning** and **continual learning**, with a focus on disentangling and enhancing the robustness of multi-view representations, as well as on developing methods for multimodal continual learning.
